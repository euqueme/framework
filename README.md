## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://majovainilla.github.io/framework/)

This is a custom framework based on some of the bootstrap classes.

Here are some of the specification of the framework:
* Column based responsive design with 12 units based on percentages and not pixels to provide a better performance.
* Included a 1% gutter to the right of the columns.
* We created five different breakpoints: 
  * -xs > 0
  * -sm > 576px
  * -md > 768px
  * -lg > 992px
  * -xl > 1200px
* We match the classes' name to those used in Bootstrap to facilitate the usage of the framework.
* Some of the most important classes we included:
  * .col-*
  * .row
  * .container
  * .d-* (flex, block, none)
  * p-* & m-* (includes 10 different sizes)
  * Border colors and background colors (different than Bootstrap)
  * Widths and heights (multiples of 10)
  * Flex classes (justify-content and align-content)
  * Basic font styles (color, font-weight and italic)

This is also part of the Odin project curriculum https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework
